# Egocentric Control for Tiago++ robot
This python codes with scripts and launch files to control the Tiago++ robot with an Omni base.

## Features

This is for ICRA2025. There are three modes for the egocentric control: `baseline` `egocentric` `Combine`. 

- The `baseline` inherits the previous control method but with obstacle avoidance and with updated fuzzy control for base control. The robot end-effectors will strictly follow the user's arm movement unless it detects that the user's movement will lead to collision with existing obstacles. In that case, it will erase the direction that may cause collision but carry on other directions.(For example, if the robot end-effectors is above the task, and user is trying to grab a bottle on the table. The end-effector will stop move downward(in z direction) but will allow user to move in planar(XY directions) 

- The `egocentric` is the novel control method also called `notouchpad` method which presented in the paper. It abandons the tradition key-press control. Instead, it allows the user to control the entire robot only use arm movement and head rotation. To be more specific, for the arm control, there exists a workspace for the arm which is calculated through maneuverability. In which, it guarantees that no collisions with other part and no singularity. When the robot end-effectors are within the workspace, it strictly follows the user's arm movement. However, when the robot end-effectors hit the boundary, depending on which boundary it hits, the robot will adjust base or torso. Similarly, the head can also control the base rotation and torso up/down movement Safety 

- The `Combine` allows the users to access the both above control method, which means the robot end-effectors will remain in the workspace and will activate base and torso control when hit the boundary while the user can also control the base and torso through key-pressing.


## Usage
 
To activate the Tiago robot, first git the repository(which should be done in the lab computer). Connect to the robot first and then open another terminal with the following commandï¼š

```
Master
IP
cd Tiago_dual_robot
source devel/setup.bash
```

To activate the `baseline`, use the following code:

`roslaunch vive_teleop vive_teleop_fall.launch sim=false record=false rviz=true`

To activate the `egocentric`, use the following code:

`roslaunch vive_teleop vive_teleop_continue_notouchpad.launch sim=false record=false rviz=true`

To activate the `combine`, use the followwing code:

`roslaunch vive_teleop vive_teleop_continue_fall.launch sim=false record=false rviz=true`

## UI

There exists two forms of UI. The `ui_baseline.py` is for the `baseline` method and `ui_ego` is for the `egocentric` and `combine` method.

- `ui_baseline.py` adds obstacle warnings, obstacle frames and robot's end-effector and elbow current location with respect to the base frame (torso_lift_link). 

- `ui_ego.py` besides everything above, it adds the boundary for the workspace and warnings for arm reaches the boundaries.

- For usage, in you workspace `python3 ui_baseline.py/ui_ego.py`. Remember to connect to the Unity first.

## Scripts overview

This section brefly illustrates the function of each `.py` in folder `scripts`, for more detail information please read the comments within each file.
