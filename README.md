# egocentric
This is for ICRA2025. There are three modes for the egocentric control: `baseline` `notouchpad` `combine`. 
The `baseline` inherits the previous control method but with obstacle avoidance fuzzy control. The robot end-effectors will strictly follows the user's arm movement unless it detects that the user's movement will leads to collision with existing obstacles. In that case, it will erase the direction that may cause collision but carry on other directions.(For example, if the robot end-effectors is above the task, and user is trying to grab a bottle on the table. The end-effector will stop move downward(in z direction) but will allow user to move in planar(XY directions) 

To activate the Tiago robot, first git the repository(which should be done in the lab computer). Connect to the robot first and then open another terminal with the following commandï¼š

`Master`

`IP`

`cd Tiago_dual_robot`

`source devel/setup.bash`
